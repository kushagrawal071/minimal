## Machine learning

Let’s look at six applications of ML in the fraud cases that exist in the real world. You have possibly experienced these frauds in one form or the other.

1. Email Phishing

This is a fraud case where the fraudsters deceive people into answering an email with their data. Using the information, they can hack into your system and loot your money.

Machine Learning uses its algorithm to distinguish between actual and spam email addresses, thus preventing fraud. They will study the subject lines, the content of the email, and the sender’s email details before dividing them into genuine or fraudulent emails.

2. Identity Theft

In this kind of fraud case, the criminals cheat your identity connected with your bank accounts. They will alter the IDs or the passwords, thus blocking entry into these accounts.

Machine Learning assures that nobody can alter the password or update the identity associated with an account. You will be notified as soon as anyone attempts to hack into your account: two-factor authentication and other measures, along with human-like intelligence, help guarantee better prevention of fraud.

3. Credit Card Theft

Through methods such as phishing, fraudsters can access your credit card details and misuse them. You would have to pay for the purchases you have not made.

Credit card fraud detection with the help of machine learning can prevent such trade-offs.

4. Document Forgery

Fake IDs are also available in the eCommerce business, which can cause many issues for the proprietor of these Ids. Machine Learning can quickly identify counterfeit identities.

The algorithm has trained its neural network to distinguish between a fraudulent and authentic identity, thus creating a full-proof system.

5. Form Jacking Credit Card Details

Form jacking is the hijacking of your credit card details. While entering the details into a particular form online, the hacker would be equipped with their means to seize the information and use it elsewhere.

This can be identified by the Machine Learning algorithms integrated into your website. It will secure the data and ensure that it does not fall into the hands of malicious attackers.

6. Fake Applications

If fraudsters have access to your IDs and other details, they can easily use it to create a credit card or any other fake application in your name. The fraud detection models have been devised for this specific reason, which accesses neural models to understand whether the application is genuine or fraudulent.

### Fraud Detection

Fraud detection is a set of processes and analyses that allow businesses to identify and prevent unauthorised financial activity. This may include fraudulent credit card transactions, identity theft, cyber hacking, insurance scams and more.

In recent years, fraud has been a significant issue in the banking, medical, insurance, and IT sectors. There has been an increase in online transactions through different payment options such as credit/debit cards, PhonePe, Gpay, Paytm, etc. Due to this, fraudulent activities have also increased. Moreover, fraudsters have become proficient in finding loopholes that they then misuse. Hence it has become a challenging task to make a secure system for authentication and preventing fraud.

This is where fraud detection algorithms powered by machine learning prove helpful.
